This is a very recent and effective approach due to which it has a really high demand in today’s market. Natural Language Processing is an upcoming field where already many transitions such as compatibility with smart devices, interactive talks with a human have been made possible. 
Knowledge representation, logical reasoning, and constraint satisfaction were the emphasis of AI applications in NLP. 
The field is divided into  three different parts:-
Speech Recognition — The translation of spoken language into text.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU)  — The computer’s ability to understand what we say.
Natural Language Generation  (NLG) — The generation of natural language by a computer.
